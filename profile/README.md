## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> **Note**: We are currently working on moving all project related to AltWalker form GitLab to GitHub.

AltWalker is an open source Model-Based Testing framework that supports running tests written in Python3 and .NET/C#. You design your tests as a directed graph and AltWalker generates test cases from your graph (using [GraphWalker](http://graphwalker.github.io/)) and executes them.

Get started with [Installation](https://altom.gitlab.io/altwalker/altwalker/installation.html) and then get a quick overview with the [Quickstart](https://altom.gitlab.io/altwalker/altwalker/quickstart.html). There is also a list of [How Toâ€™s](https://altom.gitlab.io/altwalker/altwalker/how-tos.html) and a list of runnable [Examples](https://altom.gitlab.io/altwalker/altwalker/examples.html).
